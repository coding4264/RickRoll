        <h2>Discovering coding</h2>
        <p>I first discovered coding when I was 9 years old.
            I was watching youtube when I found a video about how to code in TI-BASIC.
            I thought it was cool so I watched a hole lot a other videos about coding.
            Just for some context, Ti-basic is a programming language on the Ti-84 plus CE(A calculator).
            After a month or two, I finally got the calculator and I started hacking it.
            But then I broke it :(. I got demotevated but I pushed on.

            After that, I learned python. Python is a really good language.
            I bought a book about python (You can buy it from here: <a id="buy" href="https://www.amazon.ca/Python-easy-steps-Covers-3-7/dp/1840788127/ref=sr_1_1?crid=R2Y77XH8ELZ8&keywords=Python+in+easy+steps&qid=1672589755&sprefix=python+in+easy+steps%2Caps%2C201&sr=8-1">Buy this python book.</a>
            But saddly, I moved on to web developpement.
            And thats were Im at today.
